    <p> Hello all, my name is Jeffery and I love been called Jeff. I live in Freetown, Sierra Leone. I am from a family of five and the eldest of three children.</p>
    <p> As a child I have always loved programmers and admired what they do, and hope to be part of them. My purpose of enrolling into BYU-Idaho is to fulfill my dream of becoming a programmer and to earn a Bachelor's degree in Applied Technology.</p>
    <p> In my quiet times, I love playing the organ especially classical musics and I also picked interest in reading books. Some of my favorite authors are Brian Tracy, Simon Sinek, Charles Swindoll, Nassim Nicholas Taleb, Robert Kiyosaki etc.</p>
    <p> However, I look forward learning with you throughout this course, Thank you all.</p>
